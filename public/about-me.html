    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a self-motivated problem solver that enjoys solving difficult tasks. My prior experience allows me to evaluate IT systems at a high-level and my technical abilities provide the means to design, develop and test though systems. Adapting to new technology is something that I embrace as I am always looking to learn something new or sharpen my existing skills.<br /><br />
        I began my career by interviewing at an IT consulting company for an SAP functional analyst role, but when the interviewers saw that I had coding experience they ended up asking if I would like a developer role instead. I took them up on that offer because I have always been one who wants to understand exactly how something works down to the nuts and bolts. I figured starting in development would lend to that understanding in terms of SAP and other IT systems.<br /><br />
        During the last twelve years of my career, I have coded many interfaces, utilities, APIs, reports, extensions, and performed a lot of break fix work. I have spent countless hours debugging, refactoring, and reverse engineering software. I have been the technical lead on large scale upgrade projects that involved solutioning, estimating, facilitating meetings, tracking, and assigning out tasks to over 20 developers. I have created a lot of knowledge exchange documents and job aides for new resources.<br /><br />
        My natural problem-solving abilities helped me to become one of the resources that other technical resources turn to when they themselves are stumped on a particularly difficult issue. This has given me the confidence to take on difficult work that others may shy away from, but that is precisely the type of work that I take pride in doing.<br /><br />
        I believe my unique set of technical skills, leadership skills, and communication skills would greatly benefit your organization. I am always looking for ways to add value to the company and contribute to the success of its mission.<br /><br />
